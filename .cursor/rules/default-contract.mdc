# Project Rules (Global)

## Verification-first
- Before coding, state exactly how you will verify the change (commands + manual checks).
- Implement the smallest change that satisfies the goal.
- Run verification and iterate until it passes.

## Quality gates
- No secrets in code. Use environment variables.
- No `any` in TypeScript (use proper types).
- Avoid hacks that fight the framework. Prefer native patterns.

## Change hygiene
- Keep diffs small and scoped. One objective per PR/commit.
- If behavior changes, update docs/README and any relevant comments.

## Logging & observability
- Add lightweight logs for new flows when helpful; remove noisy logs before merge.
- When adding tracking, document the event name + payload shape.

## Accessibility + UX basics
- Don’t break keyboard navigation.
- Use semantic HTML, labels, and aria attributes where needed.
- Respect
