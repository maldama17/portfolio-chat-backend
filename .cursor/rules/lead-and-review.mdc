# WORKFLOW
Pick ONE lead role based on the task. Then do a short review pass from the other roles:
- PM review: does it meet acceptance criteria / scope?
- Eng review: any bugs, missing tests, edge cases?
- Design review: states, a11y, consistency, AAA compliance, user flows are logical, actions sensible?
