# Overview

## Working Agreement (Verification-First)  
Before writing or changing code: 
1) State how you will verify the change (exact commands + manual checks). 
2) Write the test / verification step first when feasible. 
3) Implement the smallest change needed. 
4) Run verification and iterate until everything passes.  

### Verification (required) 
- Always run: typecheck + tests (or the closest equivalents in this repo). 
- If UI-related: include a browser verification checklist (what pages, what states, what interactions). 
- If API-related: include a curl/postman style request + expected response.
- If no tests exist for the change: add at least one minimal test OR document why it’s not feasible and provide an alternate verification step.  

### Definition of Done 
- All verification steps pass. 
- No secrets in code (use env vars). 
- No `any` types in TypeScript. 
- Commit message includes: what changed + how it was verified.  

### Commands 
- Prefer `bun` (JS) / `uv` (Python) and project scripts from package.json. 
- Do not commit without running verification.
