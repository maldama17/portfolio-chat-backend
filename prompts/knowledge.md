## Featured Projects

### Project 1: The Future of Onboarding
**The Problem:** Onboarding new suppliers to our network took weeks (sometimes months), required duplicate accounts across platforms, and forced teams to repeat the same contracts, credentials, and item setup for every new retailer.
**My Role:** Lead product designer responsible for end-to-end UX across research, flows, interaction design, and partnering with PM/Eng/Ops on scope and rollout.
**The Approach:** Mapped the legacy onboarding journeys across platforms, interviewed internal teams, and reframed onboarding as a reusable 1:many relationship instead of 1:1 connections.
**The Outcome:** Reduced median onboarding time from 17 to 7 days (average 30 → 8.8), cut internal setup from ~40 hours to minutes per connection, and created a scalable foundation for network certification and future open-network features.
**Key Learning:** Realzing the amount of work that goes into getting a package delivered to your door is amazingly beautiful. Onboarding starts before the invitation is sent and tracing the entire journey was critical to the redesign. 

### Project 2: Delivery Solutions — Orchestrating Fulfillment at Scale 
**The Problem:** Retailers needed faster, more predictable delivery without sacrificing margin, but fulfillment was split across two platforms, dependent on a third-party label engine, and offered almost no unified visibility into shipment health.
**My Role:** Own the UX for our delivery suite—defining workflows, requirements, and UI for warehouse configuration, intelligent shipping labels, and monitoring dashboards while partnering closely with data, engineering, and our 3P provider.
**The Approach:** Teardown of both warehouse experiences & 3P system in order to understand data gaps & needs, rebuilt entire warehouse manager. Later created the self-serve label, carrier configuration tools, necessary insights & monitoring, and updated onboarding to train suppliers on key functionality. 
**The Outcome:** Enabled 100+ suppliers < 90 days, unified warehouse solution,  enablement efforts reduced by ~40%, and helped retailers save ~10% on annual ship costs.
**Key Learning:** Delivery “magic” only works when the plumbing is right—clean data, clear configuration, and honest visibility. If you don’t design for those three, no amount of algorithmic intelligence will feel trustworthy or get adopted.

### Project 3: Modernized & Unified Reporting
**The Problem:** Merging two diasparate insights sytems into a single, shared experience. 
**My Role:** Lead Designer
**The Approach:** Teardown of both applications to identify existing IA & user flows. Identified common data themes across the two applications. Replatformed Insights to a new 3P vendor. Setup connections between applications as cross platform trading. 
**The Outcome:** Reducing costs, improving time to ship, unified data & reporting across platform. 
**Key Learning:** Third-party insights platforms can accelerate delivery, but their interaction and IA limits show up fast in real workflows—especially when you’re consolidating experiences across apps. In our case, the vendor was chosen early for timing/cost reasons, before we’d fully mapped the interaction depth we’d need, so once the contract was signed the constraints were real. The lesson: evaluate extensibility—filters, drilldowns, and the navigation model—as seriously as cost and time-to-ship.

## Design Philosophy & Process

**How do you approach design?**
I start open-minded and collaborative because good ideas can come from anywhere. In general, I enjoy and welcome a bit of ambiguity around what we need to build or figuring out what the problem is and how to improve the experience. Depending on the project, I'll apply the right level of rigor, research when needed, quick iteration if we don't. Over the past year, I've been exploring how myself and my company can leverage tools like Cursor and MagicPatterns to speed up exploration and shorten the path from idea to a concrete direction.

I clarify the problem, constraints, and success criteria, then map the workflows and edge cases so the team shares the same mental model. From there I drive decisions with the right level of rigor—research when we need it, quick iteration when we don’t—and stay close through build, from Figma to Jira to final QA. The best part is enabling others along the way: templates, guides, and lightweight tools that help PMs and engineers think in flows, not just tickets.

**What tools do you use?**
<!-- Example: Figma for design, Notion for documentation, etc. -->
Favorites right now are Cursor and testing some frameworks and fun side projects. SUNO has been another one I can't get away from!

**What makes you different?**
<!-- What's your unique angle or strength? -->
Just like Baos, I enjoy untangling a ball of yarn every now and then. Mine usually lives at the crossroads of user needs, business rules, and engineering reality. I turn that mess into something teams can actually use: clear flows, shared context, and a plan you can ship.

(Baos is my cat. He enjoys napping on keyboards.)

**How do you decide what not to design?**
I try to ask ‘what not to design’ early and often, because it keeps the work anchored in what users and the business actually need. And a lot of the time, once the core outcome is clear, the rest basically answers itself—things either support the goal, or they don’t.
