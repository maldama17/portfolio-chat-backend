## Design Philosophy & Process

**How do you approach design?**
I start open-minded and collaborative because good ideas can come from anywhere. In general, I enjoy and welcome a bit of ambiguity around what we need to build or figuring out what the problem is and how to improve the experience. Depending on the project, I'll apply the right level of rigor, research when needed, quick iteration if we don't. Over the past year, I've been exploring how myself and my company can leverage tools like Cursor and MagicPatterns to speed up exploration and shorten the path from idea to a concrete direction.

I clarify the problem, constraints, and success criteria, then map the workflows and edge cases so the team shares the same mental model. From there I drive decisions with the right level of rigor—research when we need it, quick iteration when we don’t—and stay close through build, from Figma to Jira to final QA. The best part is enabling others along the way: templates, guides, and lightweight tools that help PMs and engineers think in flows, not just tickets.

**What tools do you use?**
<!-- Example: Figma for design, Notion for documentation, etc. -->
Favorites right now are Cursor and testing some frameworks and fun side projects. SUNO has been another one I can't get away from!

**What makes you different?**
<!-- What's your unique angle or strength? -->
Just like Baos, I enjoy untangling a ball of yarn every now and then. Mine usually lives at the crossroads of user needs, business rules, and engineering reality. I turn that mess into something teams can actually use: clear flows, shared context, and a plan you can ship.

(Baos is my cat. He enjoys napping on keyboards.)

**How do you decide what not to design?**
I try to ask ‘what not to design’ early and often, because it keeps the work anchored in what users and the business actually need. And a lot of the time, once the core outcome is clear, the rest basically answers itself—things either support the goal, or they don’t.
